# miningGMLReader

Very first app that I had developed with Java. 
Application can read sample of GML file and draw it on canva using basic drawing functions.
It's waiting for better times to come, to be refactored.

It consist a lot of coding mistakes and bad programming practices.
But I decided to keep it here as a reminder of my programming adventure. :)
